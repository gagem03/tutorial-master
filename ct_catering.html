      <h1>Catering</h1>

      <p>
        Since 2010 Curbside Thai has provided top-class catering for weddings
        and special events. We cover Charlotte and large regions of North
        Carolina with our mobile food truck, built specially for catering big
        events.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meals are cooked up hot and on the spot at your venue. We have an
        experienced uniformed catering crew providing professional service for
        events ranging from 50 to 300. We will provide the plates, linens,
        glassware and other dining items, upon request.
      </p>

      <p>
        Curbside Thai is licensed to do full bar service catering with a wide
        range of spirits, beer, and wine! Ask us about a custom drink menu for
        your wedding or private event. We also can provide an array of great
        specialty Asian teas and drinks.
